 ['Career mode','A ladder of ten opponents and venues across all four games that opens up as you win, on seven rungs of AI from novice to legend, with trophies and cosmetics as rewards. No server needed.'],
 ['Challenge games','Speed Pot, Perfect Potter and Clear the Table, each with a best.'],
 ['10-ball and straight pool','Ten-ball on the nine-ball rules; straight pool as a race to 30 with re-racks and a point off a foul (uncalled).'],
 ['House rules','Race length, what the cue ball does after a foul, who breaks, the straight-pool score, and jump shots on or off. Online tables carry the rules and are never ranked when they are not the defaults.'],
 ['Jump shots','An optional house rule: a Jump button hops the cue ball over a ball in its way. In 2D the ball swells while it is airborne; in 3D it really rises.'],
 ['Aim snapping and a follow-the-shot camera','Aim snaps to the middle of a pocket (or a one-cushion bank) when you are close, can be turned off, and the 3D camera can follow the ball with an adjustable eye height.'],
 ['Rogue Pool','A solo roguelike run: clear each table within its shots, take one of three random upgrades (wider pockets, extra shots, lives, jump charges, a scratch shield, a second wind), and lose a life when you run out. The same seed is the same run.'],
 ['Chaos Pool','A scored game to 15 with a random twist dealt before every shot: a bonus pocket worth three, a bomb ball that blasts its neighbours, or a gravity well that bends the balls. The host deals it, so both players see the same one.'],
 ['A tidier lobby and a first-run tutorial','The lobby is grouped: a primary row (Find a game, Practice vs AI, Two players on one device), the game settings (game, AI, table, house rules), then Sharpen your game (How to play, Daily shot, Drills and trick shots, Challenges, Puzzle maker) and Solo runs (Career, Rogue Pool). A new player is offered a five-step tutorial once: aim, power, cutting, spin and banks, each an ordinary drill with a plain explanation and a Show me.'],
 ['Curated trick shots','Twenty tables that one shot clears completely (eight with two balls, eight with three, four with four), under Drills. Each has a Show me button that sets up and plays the proven shot. Every one was found by searching the real physics, and the tests replay each through the physics, so a change that breaks one fails the build.'],
 ['Obstacle tables','A table option in the lobby for practice and two players on one device: Bumpers, Walls, Portals or the Gauntlet. Balls bounce off bumpers and walls and come out of the paired portal going the same way; a jump shot hops a bumper or wall. The AI, the solver and the physics all see them. Not yet: online tables, and placing your own in the puzzle maker.'],
 ['Puzzle maker','Arrange a table, pick the ball to pot, and the computer searches the real physics for a shot. Only proven-solvable tables can be shared, and a puzzle link re-proves itself when it is opened.']

 <h1>What we have built,<br><em>and what is next.</em></h1>
 <p>One roadmap. It compares the game with five commercial pool titles, lists what has shipped, ranks what is
 worth building next, and names the things we are deliberately not copying.</p>
 <p class="meta">Compiled September 2026 from each game's own store listing, so it shows what
 they advertise, not everything they do. Where a listing does not mention a feature the table says
 <strong>?</strong> (unknown), never "no". See Sources. Generated by <code>tools/build-roadmap.mjs</code>.</p>
